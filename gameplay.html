				<p>Overwatch has one of the many different types of game play you can choose right from the menu. Each one is very interesting because they can prove quite a challenge and can also be find to talk with people. Most of the games, you can choose to talk in a group or with your whole team, (if not all in a group chat) for you to talk stragety. Stragety in most of these games is what you pretty much take the win based of. Which one is interesting to you? Do you like playing wild, with your friends, or just trying out what type of game settings there are. I can say there are different type of settings for the game.</p>
				
				<p>With most of these games, you can pretty much choose the player you want to play while the system does pick the map you are going to be playing on. Quick play, practice, and the custom game pretty much is easy to do that. With the arcade, there are just some extra rules depending on the setting you choose. If it's competivite, you may want to talk with your teammates before chosing a player. You may never know what will happen in the game and must be prepaired to fight off the enemy.</p>
