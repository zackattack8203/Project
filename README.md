# Project

There are many files that are currently on this. There are html, css, and img/png images. I would keep all of these together. What you need to do is download all of them and save them on a folder.

Once all files in a folder, you will need to click on home, characters, gameplay, maps, or sources (html file) to take a look at the site. The site pretty much shows what I've done with the site and how far that I went into it. The web design class is really fun and it's good to know some ideas of how to code something that you might enjoy.
