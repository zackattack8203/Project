			<p>When it comes to Overwatch, it has many good maps that any character can to play. Whether it's the map or the team, you can really strength the both to your advantage if you know how to do so. If you are trying to protect the payload on a city town map, it might be easier to snip them or just have a tank out just to block most of the attacks. Some maps maybe easy for people to take advantage of and some may prove that it can really be a challenge. When it like fighting to a certain point, someone may really be good on doing trick shots to make the enemy player go dead and the game can move on faster. There any many ways of how people can win and lose on a map. It could be communcation, skills, or the knowledge of the map that might not help. You never know what the enemy team will give to your or the map until you have seen what they can do.</p>

			<p>There are 3 styles of Overwatch that you can play on. There maybe be a payload that you have to escort, one side might have to get to a certain point, or both sides fighting at a spot trying to get the team's percentage up in order to win. Some of these styles are very easy to keep up and some may not. It's really depending on what you got stuck with for the game's match that you will have to fight out. It may prove a challenge a challenge for some people because they may not know the map and others may have a good time of using their characters to their advantage on how to rig the map into their win.</p>
